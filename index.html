                <h1>Hi-Lo rules!</h1>
                <p><h2>&nbsp; Objective: </h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The objective of the game is to be the first player to reveal all 6 of their cards by guessing if the next card is higher and lower than the current.</p>
                    <h2>&nbsp; Getting started:</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Getting started is easy! Click on the username to change it to something more personal.
                        Now if you like what you see you can get right into the guessing! Is the next card higher or lower?
                        If you don't like what you see (just like when you look in the mirror) you can change your base card! (unlike when looking in the mirror)
                        But remember you can only change your base card once per turn, and never after you've started guessing.</p>
                    <h2>&nbsp; Gameplay: </h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you've made it this far in the rules, you are sure to be great at this game because you have dedication kid. 
                        Now that you've got your base card just where you want it, you can start guessing! Guess if the next card is higher lower using 
                        that intuition you surely possess and get it right and watch your cards grow longer! Get it wrong though and watch everything you've built get reset
                        to that last pesky base card. Good thing you save often... Right? To save your spot and ensure swift victory, just press Hold Cards and lock
                        in your spot. Just be careful because it gives the turn to that pesky person sitting next to you.
                    </p>
                    <h2>&nbsp; Are you gonna risk it all and go for the win? Or play it safe and pretend slow and steady wins the race?</h2>
